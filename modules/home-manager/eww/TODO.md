Whilst this is a good looking bar it has some things I don't need and is missing stuff i do need


## TODO:

[x] set colors
[ ] set location to somewhere closer
( These can maybe be done in an external conf file )

[ ] remove music player
[ ] update dashboard with sysinfo rather than keep in the bar
[ ] overhaul dashboard
[ ] shrink power options window (Don't need fullscreen)
[ ] add bluetooth and wifi options to the bar
[ ] update battery icon based on capacity
[ ] add click to show remaining battery capacity
[ ] update calendar to show events
[ ] fix notifications
[ ] sync color to vim mode (maybe)
